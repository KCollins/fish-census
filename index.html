<p>Hello! Here are some plots. </p>
<p>Plotly express has <a href="https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/">many options</a> for different plots, so I've just been trying a bunch of things out. Click the legend entries to turn categories on and off. To view a particular category in isolation, double-click its entry in the legend.</p>
<p>The diel plot I was thinking of (similar to Fig. 6 in that ESSD paper) would look like <a href="Moorea Fish Census Facet Diel Plot by Trophic Category.html">this.</a> (or  <a href="Moorea Fish Census Facet Diel Plot by Species.html">this</a>, if color-coded by species). It plots hour of the day versus date, colormapped to whatever variable you want to check for. I doubt that there's enough data here for day-by-day trends to show up this way, but if we had a longer dataset I'd expect to see diel variation over time. </p>
<p><a href="Moorea Fish Census Facet Count Bar.html">A stackplot of all the data over the length of the monitored period, separated by time range but not by site.</a> (It's not correct, because I'm using "Intervals" where there should be a time index, so some things are probably overlapping that shouldn't be. Might be a good way to show all the data in one place, though, if the timestamps were aligned.)</p>
<p><a href="Moorea Fish Census Histogram.html">Here's a histogram showing total counts for each trophic group, faceted by time range but not by site.</a> </p>

<p>(Plotly express can also do box plots, but I haven't done anything with that yet.)</p>
